ABSTRACT

This study aims to investigate the use of active methodologies in teaching Mathematics within the context of basic education, focusing on the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The proposal arises from the need to rethink traditional teaching practices by adopting approaches that promote greater student engagement and meaningful learning. The research was conducted in a high school class at a public school through the application of activities based on project-based learning (PBL) and the use of educational software. Data collection was carried out through participant observation, student interviews, and analysis of practical activity results. The findings indicated that active methodologies contributed to greater student motivation, fostering collaborative learning and autonomy in the learning process. Furthermore, an improvement in students' performance in mathematical activities was observed, with increased ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical situations. It is concluded that the use of active methodologies in Mathematics teaching can represent an effective alternative to promote more contextualized and meaningful learning, as well as spark students' interest in the subject, contributing to the formation of critical and reflective citizens.
